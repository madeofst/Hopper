// Fixes
* Check that new coin tile location is not already a coin tile
* Improve score assignment
* Investigate occasional crashing - seems to be when moving onto a goal tile

//Possible process improvements
* Maybe only introduce timer after Level 1 or 2
* Transfer to path finding algorithm for coins?
* Correct score values for unreachable coins (aka other side of goal)

// Definite additions
* Add jump tile
* Add max hop limit increase tile
* Add timer extension tile

// Potential additons
* Add impassable tiles - will need pathfinding for automatic placement
* make goals unlockable with a minimum score - this could allow for actual puzzle design.

// Possible additions
* Enemies to dodge?

//Plan in steps
* Add a splash screen
* Design and add visual representation of timer and hops
* Draw/find sprites for
    - lily pad
    - frog
    - coin (points)
    - water
