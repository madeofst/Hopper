    //Pathfinding
    * Transfer to path finding algorithm for coins?
    * Correct score values for unreachable coins (aka other side of goal)
    * Add impassable tiles - will need pathfinding for automatic placement

    //Tiles
    * Permanent/semi-permanent change of jump length
    * Add bounce tile? - auto bounce


// For more designable puzzle version

    * Enemies to dodge?
    * missing lilypads - frog can dive in and swim under to the next opening at a cost of only one hop
