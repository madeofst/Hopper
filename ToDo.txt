    * more the same, slower progression

    -VISUAL DESIGN
    * are you sure you want to quit
    * redesign boundary to make grid clearer

    //Possible bugs
    * bug with timer on shaky score text - not sure what this actually is any more (maybe fixed)
    * bug with player on top of title after restart (can't replicate currently)

    //Possible improvements
    * introduce the rock on a simpler one
    * make it clearer how many hops you need on the water teaching ones
    * timing of hop counter
    * add body visible underwater 
    * add shadows
    * add water shadows in
    * consider a wider grid

    //Animations
    * goal tile to go purple quicker
    * fail level to be neated up
    * restart to be a matching portal to goal
    * frog still (eyes blinking)
    * eat bug

    //Pathfinding
    * Transfer to path finding algorithm for coins?
    * Correct score values for unreachable coins (aka other side of goal)
    * Add impassable tiles - will need pathfinding for automatic placement

    //Tiles
    * Permanent/semi-permanent change of jump length
    * Add bounce tile? - auto bounce - would need a new animation
    * multiple goals?

    //Presentational
    * Animate main menu
    * Improve score assignment
    * bounce and double bounce improvments

    // For timed mode
    * Timer reduces with each goal reached?
    * Add max hop limit increase tile
    * Add timer extension tile
    * Introduce hop limit first, then expand grid, then timer, then reduce timer/timer extension
    * Redesign timer
