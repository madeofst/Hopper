// Definites

    // Fixes
    * Improve score assignment
    
    // Definite additions
    * Timer reduces with each goal reached?
    * Add jump tile
    * Add max hop limit increase tile
    * Add timer extension tile
    * Introduce hop limit first, then expand grid, then timer, then reduce timer/timer extension

    //Plan in steps
    * Design and add visual representation of timer and hops
    * Animate main menu
    * Draw/find sprites for
        - water
    * Animations
        - frog still (eyes blinking)
        - frog hop down
        - frog hop side
        - frog hop up
    * Sound FX
        - coin
        - goal

    //Pathfinding
    * Transfer to path finding algorithm for coins?
    * Correct score values for unreachable coins (aka other side of goal)
    * Add impassable tiles - will need pathfinding for automatic placement


// For more designable puzzle version
_________________________

    * make goals unlockable with a minimum score - this could allow for actual puzzle design.
    * Enemies to dodge?
    * missing lilypads - frog can dive in and swim under to the next opening at a cost of only one hop
