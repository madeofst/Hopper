    * Sound FX
        - game over
        - eat bug

    //Pathfinding
    * Transfer to path finding algorithm for coins?
    * Correct score values for unreachable coins (aka other side of goal)
    * Add impassable tiles - will need pathfinding for automatic placement

    //Tiles
    * Permanent/semi-permanent change of jump length
    * Add bounce tile? - auto bounce - would need a new animation
