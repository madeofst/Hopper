    //Possible improvements
    * timing of hop counter
    * add body visible underwater 
    * add shadows
    * add water shadows in
    * consider a wider grid

    * Animations
        - frog still (eyes blinking)
        - eat bug
        - start level (maybe) (open up portal and jump out?)

    //Pathfinding
    * Transfer to path finding algorithm for coins?
    * Correct score values for unreachable coins (aka other side of goal)
    * Add impassable tiles - will need pathfinding for automatic placement

    //Tiles
    * Permanent/semi-permanent change of jump length
    * Add bounce tile? - auto bounce - would need a new animation
    * multiple goals?

    //Presentational
    * Animate main menu
    * Improve score assignment

    // For timed mode
    * Timer reduces with each goal reached?
    * Add max hop limit increase tile
    * Add timer extension tile
    * Introduce hop limit first, then expand grid, then timer, then reduce timer/timer extension
    * Redesign timer
