    // Fixes
    -MAIN GAME

    -LEVEL EDITOR
    * Level editor - autosaving and updates
    * input not activating on player when in test mode

    //Necessary improvements
    
    -LEVEL DESIGN
    * introduce the rock on a simpler one
    * make it clearer how many hops you need on the water teaching ones
    * jump over a pad into the water - need to teach
    * more the same, slower progression

    -VISUAL DESIGN
    * are you sure you want to quit
    * redesign boundary to make grid clearer
    * improve try again and stop input
    * introduce water in simpler puzzles (but more complex than just a line)

    -ANIMATIONS
    * make the goal tile more obvious - hole which opens up and you jump into (with a flag that pops up behind?)
    * complete level (open up portal and jump in?)
    * fail level
    
    -SOUND
    * game over
    * eat bug
    * bounce

    //Possible bugs
    * bug with timer on shaky score text - not sure what this actually is any more (maybe fixed)
    * bug with player on top of title after restart (can't replicate currently)

    //Possible improvements
    * timing of hop counter
    * add body visible underwater 
    * add shadows
    * add water shadows in
    * consider a wider grid

    * Animations
        - frog still (eyes blinking)
        - eat bug
        - start level (maybe) (open up portal and jump out?)

    //Pathfinding
    * Transfer to path finding algorithm for coins?
    * Correct score values for unreachable coins (aka other side of goal)
    * Add impassable tiles - will need pathfinding for automatic placement

    //Tiles
    * Permanent/semi-permanent change of jump length
    * Add bounce tile? - auto bounce - would need a new animation
    * multiple goals?

    //Presentational
    * Animate main menu
    * Improve score assignment
    * bounce and double bounce improvments

    // For timed mode
    * Timer reduces with each goal reached?
    * Add max hop limit increase tile
    * Add timer extension tile
    * Introduce hop limit first, then expand grid, then timer, then reduce timer/timer extension
    * Redesign timer

1200 * 675
