    // Fixes
    * Level editor - saving after a change
    * Level editor - autosaving and updates
    * Bug when clicking play in editor with no level selected
    * timing of hop counter (possibly)
    * bug with timer on shaky score text
    * bug when trying to jump into water towards a rock/edge of map
    
    // Definite additions
    * Timer reduces with each goal reached?
    * Add max hop limit increase tile
    * Add timer extension tile
    * Introduce hop limit first, then expand grid, then timer, then reduce timer/timer extension

    //Plan in steps
    * Redesign timer
    * Design score target/value HUD
    * Animations
        - frog still (eyes blinking)
        - diving into and jumping out of water
        - complete level (open up portal and jump in?)
        - eat bug
        - start level (maybe) (open up portal and jump out?)
    * Sound FX
        - hop
        - double jump
        - bug
        - goal unlocked
        - goal reached
        - level restart
        - game over
    * Music
        - end Music

    //Pathfinding
    * Transfer to path finding algorithm for coins?
    * Correct score values for unreachable coins (aka other side of goal)
    * Add impassable tiles - will need pathfinding for automatic placement

    //Tiles
    * Permanent/semi-permanent change of jump length
    * Add bounce tile? - auto bounce - would need a new animation

    //Presentational
    * Animate main menu
    * Improve score assignment
